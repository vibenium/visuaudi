Introduction: 
	visaudi is a cli that converts an image file to a wav file.

Background:
	Image to wav file conversion is achieved through creating
	a linear array containing the averaged RGB values per pixel.
	This new array will then be stretched and smoothed depending 
	on how long the audio file is desired to be (in seconds) by
	the argument provided by the user. Then that newly defined
	array will be converted into an audio signal in a .wav
	format.
